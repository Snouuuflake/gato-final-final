If you are read this, it means that you are one of whom can See, yet also be Seen. It also means that you are able to See Him. He who was banished by the new gods for aboniable power and simultaneous lack of care for that which surrounds Him. A demon to many; a god to those past. An elevated Being, brought down to the least of moral lows by the premise of pillage and wager; the idea of victory, at first consisting of conquest of worlds, but now, no more than boasting and swagger. It is then how He decended to your Plane, taking form after the first being to become known to Him. Now bounded by a mere nth-dimensional shell, He roams, seeking those who may contest him, for any prize, once more. But beware: in spite of his lost status as Warleader of the Ancients, of Him is the desire to seek stakes of the grandest nature. Though limited in values to respect friendly competition, once engaged in a true challenge, the pillars of what you have, can, and will every know, will be nearly destined to be consumed.
